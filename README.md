# The-CountDown-Timer

A count down timer that helps you keep track of how many hours you want to spend on a project/hobby weekly

The countdown timer is set up for enabling the user to set a goal of putting x hours a week devoted to a project. Then the user just starts and stops the time when they are working on the project. When the user stops the time, the timer askes why are you stopping? The user is then able to review the different times they stopped and why. This enables the user to look into their productivity to hopefully encourage reflection on how they might improve. The timer then counts down from the number of hours that the user specifies. The user can watch as the timer counts down to zero and then congratulating the user once the time spent has been accomplished.
